Mental health has been shown to be a common problem in IB schools. From feeling overwhelmed to struggling with depression, IB students are being faced with mental health concerns at an alarming rate. This is tragic because mental health impacts every aspect of our lives, including academic performance.

IB schools are one of the most rigorous programs in the world, so itâ€™s no surprise that students might experience mental health concerns. Students often feel overwhelmed by the massive amounts of work required for success; many students find that their grades and test scores drop as a result. There is an increasing recognition that evidence-based prevention, intervention and treatment for mental health issues are essential for healthy outcomes. Schools are at the forefront of these efforts to help students develop social, emotional, and cognitive skills. However, there is a real need to ensure that schools have evidence-based policies in place when it comes to supporting the well-being of students.

It's important to remember that we can't always rely on parents or other adults in the community as a primary response point when it comes to supporting our children in school. We have a collective responsibility to ensure that schools have policies and practices in place that support the well-being of students, staff and the community.
