I conducted a survey among my schoolmates with ages from 12-16 about their mental health, the conducted survey ended up with such results:

With my collected results I can conclude that most teenagers value academic validation and achieving the best at school which leads to school being the cause of their mental health struggles, we know that high-quality education is only one part of a child's well-being. But what about the other factors that contribute to a student's success? What if we could find ways to promote the health and safety of our students and empower them to lead healthier lives, too? That's why Iâ€™m introducing IB schools with a well-being policies.
