It is not in the best interest of IB program schools to have policies that are vague, so these policies should be clear, concise and easy to follow. A good policy will include all of the minimum requirements for each student; when it comes to mental health, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Here are some policies schools must follow to maintain a safe environment among students:

* Allow all members of the school community to participate in important school decisions through consultations, polls, referendums, class representative elections, student council elections, feedback on classroom learning activities, and elements of student choice related to subjects taught and teaching methods in use.

* Create a welcoming climate in which everyone at school feels supported and protected by providing access to meaningful activities. Clubs, organizations, interest groups, and associations concerned with issues affecting young people, particularly health.
* Find chances in your curriculum to involve kids in topics like as healthy food, exercise, substance misuse, and constructive relationships, as well as checking in on them and providing them assistance if they appear to need it.

* Introduce less stressful techniques of assessment to lessen student anxiety about examinations and tests.

* Use instructional strategies that promote a pleasant classroom environment and well-being, such as collaborative learning, student-centered methods, self-directed time, and activities.

* Including democratic citizenship and cross-cultural education in a variety of academics and extracurricular activities. Individual and societal openness to different cultures, knowledge and critical comprehension of human rights in social sciences, and empathy in literature.

* Implementing a student-led dispute resolution process as well as a bullying and harassment prevention strategy.

* Improving educational environments to make them more accessible to students. New furniture and fittings, carpets, a decent color scheme, a secure restroom area, and communal spaces are all available.

* Promoting better eating by providing nutritious selections in school cafeterias; avoiding excessive levels of sugar, saturated fat, and salt, considering children’s allergies to avoid certain foods or to mention in what ingredients are used in certain foods.It is not in the best interest of IB program schools to have policies that are vague, so these policies should be clear, concise and easy to follow.
